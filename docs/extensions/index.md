# Extensions
Extensions are one of the ways users can customize their experience on YAB. An extension (typically coded in JS) provides certain features to enhance the users experience or add some kind of tool not already present.
As mentioned, unlike websites they do not run lua since its easier if the extensions are written in the same language as the browser itself, but there is an option to inject lua if you really need to.
